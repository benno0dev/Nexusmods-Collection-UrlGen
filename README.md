# Nexusmods Collection Url Generator
A python script that creates you a url list of all mods in a nexusmods mod collection

# Installation
## Default Installation
- Download latest version from "releases" tab and run the .exe
- Finished ðŸ¥³
## Run source
- Install Python
- Clone the repository or just download easyconf.py (or main.py if you dont want to use the command prompt)
- Finished ðŸ¥³

# How to use?
First of all, configurate the script (see [Config](https://github.com/benno0dev/Nexusmods-Collection-UrlGen/#Config)). (NOT NEEDED IF USING easyconf.py OR THE .exe)\
I assume you already downloaded the pack or at least added it, so a collection.json was created at ```%appdata%\Vortex\<game>\<collection+some numbers>\collection.json``` but check ```vortex > settings > mods``` for that.\
Now copy the collection.json to the folder the script is in and execute the script.\
Now a collection.bat or what ever you put as your file type was created.\
Thats all, have fun!

# Config
! only needed when using the main.py script
TXT_MODE:
- True: just writes the urls in seperate lines
- False: writes a "start" in front of every url, so it automatically opens every url in your default browser

FILE_TYPE:
> technically all files types are supported, these are just the ones i recommend
  - txt
  - sh (not tested if it works with TXT_MODE off)
  - bat

GAME_NAME:
- Enter the name of the game that is used in the nexusmods url (e.g. "cyberpunk2077")

DOWNLOAD_MODE:
- vortex: opens download page for vortex mod manager
- normal: opens download page for normal download (zip file)
- file: opens only the files tab
- none: doesn't open download page / opens the description page
